        <p class="lead head-desc-second">Users Approval</p>

        <p class="lead head-small">
            All the users who are interested in taking part at our platform agree to the terms and conditions given below.
            <br />
            Users may accept this Agreement only:
        </p>

        <p class="lead head-small">1. if such User is a natural Person, is of the legal age (18 years or more), eligibility and mental capacity to form a binding contract with us.</p>
        <p class="lead head-small">2. if such User is a not a resident of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Assam, Orissa, Kerala, Sikkim, Nagaland or Gujarat.</p>
        <p class="lead head-small">3. if such User is a juristic Person, is lawfully existing and has all the authorizations, permits and allowances to enter into this Agreement and form a binding contract.</p>
        <p class="lead head-small">4. such User is not legally barred, suspended or restricted from using the App.</p>

        <p class="lead head-desc-second">Provision of the App</p>


        <p class="lead head-small">
            1. Section 12 of the Public Gambling Act, 1867 provides that games of mere skill are exempt from the application of the Act. The Supreme Court of India and various High Courts in India have opined that a game of mere skill is a game “in which, although the element of chance necessarily cannot be entirely eliminated, success depends principally upon the superior knowledge, training, attention, experience and adroitness of the player. A game of skill is one in which the element of skill predominates over the element of chance.” No penalty can be imposed upon a person for playing such games of skill.
        </p>
        <p class="lead head-small">
            2. Users and Players must note that Games such as Battlegrounds India, Garena Free Fire, COD Mobile, Ludo, etc. which are available on our platform are ‘Games of Skill’, under Indian law, and that we does not support, endorse or offer users ‘games of chance’ for money. While ‘Games of Skill’ do not have a comprehensive definition, they are those games where the impact of a player’s effort and skill on the outcome of a game is higher than the impact of luck and chance.
        </p>
        <p class="lead head-small">
            3. It may be noted that States are permitted, by the Indian Constitution, to enact laws regulating betting and gambling in their respective jurisdictions. In furtherance of these powers, various States have enacted anti- gambling legislations. Such legislations are largely in concert with the Public Gambling Act of 1867 (and include the exception of “games of skill”). Where a State legislation on gambling exists, it prevails over the Public Gambling Act of 1867. In this regard, the Assam Game and Betting Act, 1970 and Orissa (Prevention of) Gambling Act, 1955 and Telangana State Gaming (Amendment) Ordinance and High Court Judgment in Gujarat, 2017 prohibits games with money stakes and also does not create an exception for games of skill. Therefore, currently, residents of Assam, Odisha, Telangana and Gujarat are not permitted to play and take part in any events on our platform.
        </p>
        <p class="lead head-small">
            4. The games rules are clearly defined on this platform and all the users and participants are encouraged to read, understand and follow these rules to be successful in these games.
        </p>
        <p class="lead head-small">
            5. The games on our platform are ‘Games of Skills’, such that the outcome / success in the games is directly dependent on the User’s effort, performance and skills. By choosing how to play, the actions of Users shall have direct impact on the game.
        </p>
        <p class="lead head-small">
            6. Every game will have some elements of chance, but in the form of challenges, obstacles or levels that a User would be able to overcome using his/her skills and knowledge of the game. Elements of luck are present in every game to add thrill and excitement, but no two attempts at a game are identical so Users must use their skills in order to be successful.
        </p>
        <p class="lead head-small">       
            7. Since the games available on our platform can be won through Users’ skills and such skills may be enhanced with practice and experience, the performance of a User may improve with time and practice.
        </p>
        <p class="lead head-small">
            8. Certain games may have pre-determined outcomes (such as in Ludo Board Game), and these outcomes are achievable by Users using their skills.
        </p>
        <p class="lead head-small">
            9. These games involves an element of financial risk and may be addictive. Please play responsibly and at your own risk.
